 I’ve met many web developers in my life, most of them great guys. And while it certainly isn’t true that each developer is a nerd, and struggles with social interactions, I can confirm that communication skills do not belong to greatest strengths of most front-end and back-end web developers. At the end of the day, a typical web developer spends more time with their computer screen than they do with people. And social skills come with practice. As a result, many web developers struggle with job applications and interviews, even with basic questions, such as the (in)famous icebreaker “Tell me about yourself”. If it is also your case, you landed on the right website. I will show you how to deal with this question.
Let’s move straight to 7 sample answers. I tried to include on my list answers for computer science students, fresh graduates, developers with little experience, and also answers fort people who’ve spent years building websites, yet still struggle to introduce themselves in the interviews. I hope you will find at least one of them fitting for your interview and present life situation. You will find some additional notes at the end of the article, explaining some nuances of a “perfect answer” to this interview question.

            Attitude<br/>
            Attitude is the way you look at life. It is the way you choose to see and respond to events, situations, people, and yourself. Your attitude is not something that happens to you. You choose your attitude. Your attitude is created by your thoughts, and you choose your thoughts.
